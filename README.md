## Practical Integrity

- Write your name and student ID as comment at the top of the Java file
- Every submission should be each student’s original work
- Plagiarising another person’s or from any other resources like the Internet is considered cheating
- Cheating could result in zero mark for the practical and subject to disciplinary hearing

In essence, what you submit is your own work, without help from others in anyway (unless cited in the submission).

## Academic Integrity

#### Writing Code


Writing code is similar to academic writing in that <b>when you use or adapt code developed by someone else as part of your project, you must cite your source.</b> However, instead of quoting or paraphrasing a source, you include an inline comment in the code. These comments not only ensure you are giving proper credit, but help with code understanding and debugging.
